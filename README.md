This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Stripe configuration

To enable card payments you must provide your live keys both locally and in Vercel:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_MDVPbMYkQRglPeHqes5L17a7
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://lpbme-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

Create a `.env.local` file with the values above before running `npm run dev`.  
Remember to replicate the variables in the Vercel dashboard (`Project Settings → Environment Variables`) for production.
